# Implementation-of-Logistic-Regression-Using-Gradient-Descent

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the the Logistic Regression Using Gradient Descent.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import the data file and import numpy, matplotlib and scipy.
2. Visulaize the data and define the sigmoid function, cost function and gradient descent.
3. Plot the decision boundary .
4. Calculate the y-prediction.

## Program:


## Output:


## Result:
Thus the program to implement the the Logistic Regression Using Gradient Descent is written and verified using python programming.
